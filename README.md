# Crypto Forward Score

Find out how proficient you (or anyone) is/are with crypto in less than 5 seconds. No web3 logins, no approvals, no permissions.

## Why use it

For web3 enterprises, there is no quick & easy way to determine who is "crypto-forward" - meaning who really understands & uses crypto. For individuals, there is no quick & easy way to get started learning crypto nor self-assess what you already know or have done. This app is simple, solving the "who is crypto forward?" problem & the "what do I already know in crypto?" problem - using wallet addressses, it gives a single crypto-forward score with next steps on how to become more crypto proficient.
